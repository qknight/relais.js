a node.js application running on my raspberry pi. it controls a set of tinkerforge dual relay bricklets using a master brick.

# relais-tool/
i'm mainly controlling 4 tinkerforge dual relais bricklets using a master brick attached via usb to a raspberry pi.

since there are no tinkerforge bindings for node.js i came up with a simple c implementation which
can be found in the directory relais-tool/

## dependencies: 
  in order to bulid the relais-tool one needs 
  - tinkerforge_c_bindings_2_0_11.zip
